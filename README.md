<h2>What I mean by "kill me when I die":</h2><br><br>

Have you ever noticed that many people who are no longer active, or who have passed away, still have their digital accounts active?<br> A lot of scams happen because of this. Hackers sometimes take over accounts of deceased people and chat with others by using their identity. I even heard this happen from a friend‚Äôs experience.

Basically, people who no longer use digital apps deserve privacy too.<br><br> Most people never think about unfortunate circumstances like, ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm no longer alive, but my digital account, which contains my emotional posts, chats, and memories is still active?‚Äù That account could be used for scams, or even by close people to uncover personal secrets. Worse, digital companies could keep using those accounts for AI training.

<br>If you think about it, two of these risks scamming and lack of privacy are already happening today. <br>And the third one, accounts being used for AI training, is very likely to happen soon. So, if people dream of ‚Äúresting in peace‚Äù after death, shouldn‚Äôt their digital accounts also rest in peace?

<br>That‚Äôs why I propose the idea of <h4>‚ÄúKill Me When I‚Äôm Gone‚Äù </h4>automatic digital account deactivation or deletion. Since we can‚Äôt predict the future, users should have an option to enable this setting. This way, accounts will automatically be deactivated or deleted after death or prolonged inactivity, without depending on family or trusted people to request deletion later.<br><br>
<h2>Research on Digital Account Deactivation and Deletion</h2><br>

I researched whether major digital platforms have thought about what happens to user accounts after long-term inactivity or death. Some companies have already created settings for this, but most users don‚Äôt know about them. Understanding these settings, how to enable them, and their disadvantages is very important.<br>

I focused on the most widely used apps, Google, Facebook, Instagram, Telegram. since these are platforms where people frequently share posts, chats, photos, and memories. However, my idea is not limited to these; it should be implemented in all applications that involve user interaction.

<h3>Why Companies Keep Inactive or Deceased Accounts</h3><br>

<h4>Most companies have little incentive to remove inactive or deceased accounts. Some reasons include:</h4><br>

üîπ 1. User Count = Business Value
Social media companies report ‚Äúactive users‚Äù to investors. The higher the number, the more valuable they look. Deleting inactive or deceased accounts would reduce these numbers and hurt business value.

üîπ 2. Data = Asset
Even if someone is deceased, their data (posts, likes, networks) is valuable. Companies use it for AI training, marketing analysis, and behavioral statistics.

üîπ 3. Digital Presence = Engagement
Friends and family often interact with memorialized accounts, which still generates engagement and traffic for the platform.

üîπ 4. Legal Loophole
In many countries, there are no strong laws about digital inheritance. This allows companies to keep accounts indefinitely unless family members request deletion.
