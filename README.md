<h2>What I mean by "kill me when I die":</h2><br><br>

Have you ever noticed that many people who are no longer active, or who have passed away, still have their digital accounts active?<br> A lot of scams happen because of this. Hackers sometimes take over accounts of deceased people and chat with others by using their identity. I even heard this happen from a friend’s experience.

Basically, people who no longer use digital apps deserve privacy too.<br><br> Most people never think about unfortunate circumstances like, “What if I’m no longer alive, but my digital account, which contains my emotional posts, chats, and memories is still active?” That account could be used for scams, or even by close people to uncover personal secrets. Worse, digital companies could keep using those accounts for AI training.

<br>If you think about it, two of these risks scamming and lack of privacy are already happening today. <br>And the third one, accounts being used for AI training, is very likely to happen soon. So, if people dream of “resting in peace” after death, shouldn’t their digital accounts also rest in peace?

<br>That’s why I propose the idea of <h4>“Kill Me When I’m Gone” </h4>automatic digital account deactivation or deletion. Since we can’t predict the future, users should have an option to enable this setting. This way, accounts will automatically be deactivated or deleted after death or prolonged inactivity, without depending on family or trusted people to request deletion later.
